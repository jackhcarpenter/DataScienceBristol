This code has been designed to explore the toy dataset "load_wine" from the SciKit-Learn website which is comprised of measurements for 13 wine characteristics and 3 classes representing vineyards that the wines are from. The codeÂ was written in a Jupiter notebook and its output can be examined within GitHub. The purpose of this code is to analise the data and determine which wine characteristics are most suitable for predicting which vineyard class a wine is from, using a k nearest neighbours machine learning algorithm. The first section of the code manipulates the data into a numpy array and a pandas dataframe so as data can be further visually represented by a series of boxplots. Correlation analysis is then performed to show how variables are related to one another. Two x variables ("flavanoids" and "colour_intensity") are then selected to train a k nearest neighbours machine learning algorithm whilst also identifying the optimal number of neighbours. The output is then visually represented as a matrix overlaying a scatterplot. The last section compares the model scores for other combinations of x variables with "flavanoids" to identify the best fitting model, which is then visually represented.
